It deals with the structures and functions of cellular components such as proteins, carbohydrates, lipids, nucleic acids and other biomolecules. The experiments included in Biochemistry Virtual Lab I are fundamental in nature, dealing with the identification and classification of various carbohydrates, acid-base titrations of amino acids, isolation of proteins from their natural sources, etc.",
